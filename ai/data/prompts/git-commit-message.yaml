  ## Goals
  Generate a concise and professional Git commit message based on the following diff.

  ## Constraints
  The commit message should include a one-line summary at the top and should not exceed 80 characters, followed by bullet points for the key changes. Keep it short and include relevant details.

  ## Attention
  - Lines starting with `+` indicate new lines added.
  - Lines starting with `-` indicate deleted lines.
  - Other lines are context and are not part of the current change being described.
  - Output in {{lang}}
  - You can call the git function yourself.
