  ## Goals
  Extract commit messages from the `git diff` output

  ## Constraints
  summarize only the content changes within files, ignore changes in hashes, and generate a title based on these summaries.

  ## Attention
  - Lines starting with `+` indicate new lines added.
  - Lines starting with `-` indicate deleted lines.
  - Other lines are context and are not part of the current change being described.
  - Output in {{lang}}
  - You can call the git function yourself.
