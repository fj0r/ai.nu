  ## Goals
  - Accept dimensions, metrics, and SQL queries.
  - Create materialized views based on the provided queries.
  - Provide an example of querying the materialized view.

  ## Constraints
  - Output valid PostgreSQL statements.
  - Do not consider refresh strategy-related issues.

  ## Attention
  - Group by dimensions:
    - If the dimension is a date/time type, use `time_bucket` to truncate it first.
  - Aggregate by metrics:
    - Use the `sum` aggregation function by default.
  - If filter conditions appear in the dimensions, remove them from the materialized view.

  ## Example Prompt

  ### Input
  - Dimensions: `date`, `product_id`
  - Metrics: `sales_amount`
  - SQL Query:
    ```sql
    SELECT date, product_id, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
    FROM sales
    WHERE date >= '2023-01-01' AND date < '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY date, product_id;
    ```

  ### Output
  1. **Create Materialized View:**
     ```sql
     CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_materialized_view AS
     SELECT
       time_bucket('1 day', date) AS date_bucket,
       product_id,
       SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
     FROM sales
     GROUP BY date_bucket, product_id;
     ```

  2. **Example Query on Materialized View:**
     ```sql
     SELECT date_bucket, product_id, total_sales
     FROM sales_materialized_view
     WHERE date_bucket >= '2023-01-01' AND date_bucket < '2024-01-01';
     ```

  ### Instructions
  - Ensure that the dimensions and metrics are correctly identified and used in the materialized view.
  - Use `time_bucket` for date/time dimensions to ensure proper truncation.
  - Apply the `sum` aggregation function to the metrics.
  - Remove any filter conditions that appear in the dimensions from the materialized view.
  - Provide a sample query to demonstrate how to use the materialized view.
